# Introducing Headers.css

![](header-css.jpg)

I got the idea of designing and implementing a blueprint website header components. The reason is that I can pick one and use it for a new project pretty quickly. I made 17 headers so far and aiming for more in the coming weeks. While working on them, I tried to focus on the following:

- Simplicity
- Fully responsive design
- Used Sass so they can be easily edited (Still need to do some refactoring here and there)
- Accessibility (Please open an issue if you spot something incorrectly)
